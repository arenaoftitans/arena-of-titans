Setup
=====

- NodeJS (latest version, https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Firefox and Chrome to launch unit tests
- `Python 3.4+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ to build the configuration (please tick 'Add python.exe to Path' during install). If you  are on Windows, you will need to copy ``python.exe`` into ``python3.exe`` for the script to work.

You can now install the node dependencies. To do so, launch in the folder in which you cloned this repository:

- Install node modules: ``npm install``

Configuration
-------------

The configuration of the front end (used to choose on which host it must connect to the api and to enable the debug mode) is written in ``./config/application.js`` based on values from:

- ``./config/config.dev.toml`` when building for development.
- ``./config/config.prod.toml`` when building for production. The values in this file are used to deploy the application on the server and thus are tracked by git. They must not be tampered with unless you know what you are doing.
- ``./config/config.staging.toml`` when building for staging. The values in this file are used to deploy the application on the server and thus are tracked by git. They must not be tampered with unless you know what you are doing.
- ``./config/config.testing.toml`` when buiding for testing. See the README of the API for more information on that.

Use the API from staging when developing the frontend
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This allows you to develop the frontend without running an API locally. This is specially useful if you develop only on the frontend (eg you are a designer) and don't want to bother with the API.

To build the frontend for development and use the API from the staging server, copy ``./config/config.staging.toml`` into ``./config/config.dev.toml``.

Use a local version of the API
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Copy ``./config/config.staging.toml`` into ``./config/config.dev.toml``. Then, adapt the values in it. There are two cases (look at the README for the API to learn more about them):

#. Launch the API and make it directly accessible. In this case, you want to update the values below in the ``api`` section (the given values suppose that you are using the default values for the API):

   .. code:: ini

      host = '127.0.0.1'
      path = ''
      port = 9000

#. Run the API behind a proxy. In this case, you want to the values of host, port and path to match your proxy configuration. For instance:

   .. code:: ini

      host = 'api.aot'
      path = '/ws/{version}'


Usage
=====

- To launch the development server, use ``npm run dev``. This will compile the app for development in memory, launch a webserver, watch for any changes and reload your page once the changes are taken into account. If you get an error like ``python3 not found``, check that:

  - When you installed Python, you added it to the PATH
  - Copy your ``python.exe`` from your Python install directory into ``python3.exe``

- To launch tests on time, use ``npm run test`` You can choose the browsers on which the tests will be executed with the ``-b BROWSER`` option. For intance: ``npm run test -- -b Chrome`` or ``npm run test -- -b Chrome -b Firefox``. Default browsers are Firefox and Chrome. You can view the list of available browsers in `karma's documentation <http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/browsers.html>`__.
- To launch tests automatically when a modification is done, use ``npm run tdd`` You can choose the browsers on which the tests will be executed. See above.
- To build all the files as in dev, use ``npm run builddev``
- To build the files for prod, use ``npm run buildprod``
- To build the config like in dev, use ``npm run config -- --type dev --version latest`` You can adapt the build type and the version if needed.
- To clean the build folder, use ``npm run clean``
- To lint the JS and SCSS files, use ``npm run lint`` This is equivalent to running ``npm run jslint && npm run stylelint``
- To lint only the JS files, use ``npm run jslint``
- To lint only the SCSS files, use ``npm run stylelint``
- To update the translations, use ``npm run translate``.
- To update the sprites of the cards, use ``npm run sprites``. **Check that in the url( statements no quotes are used!**


Contributing
============

Be sure that (this can be configured in your text editor or your IDE):

- Your files are encoded in UTF-8
- You use Unix style line ending (also called LF)
- You remove the trailing whitespaces
- You pull your code using ``git pull --rebase=preserve``

Code style
----------

- Wrap your code in 100 characters to ease reading.
- Use spaces, not tabs.
- Use 4 spaces to indent and 8 for continuation indentation. It is intended to avoid lines starting far at in the right.

Code organization
-----------------

The code is written with the `Aurelia JavaScript framework <http://aurelia.io/>`__. We can distinguish three main categories:

- Pages: a web page used in the routers.
- Services: they are instanced once and injected as needed in the others elements (services or widgets) of the application. They provide state and useful methods. They are similar to services in AngularJS.
- Widgets: It is an element (component or Custom Element in Aurelia's terminology) instantiated in the DOM of the application. A widget can be instantiated multiple times and each instance is independent of the others. It consists of a JS file, an HTML template and, if needed, a SCSS file for its style. All these files are grouped in a folder named after the widget. They are similar to directives in AngularJS.

The code is then organized as follow:

- The ``app`` folder contains the code of the application (JS and HTML). It is structured as follow:

  - Directly in the folder the bootstrap files for the application.
  - The ``game`` folder for everything related to the game. This folder is then splitted in:

    - ``game.js`` and ``game.html`` the main page for the game. It contains a router to navigate between create and play.
    - ``create`` for widgets and services used to create the game.
    - ``play`` for widgets and services used to play the game.
    - ``services`` for services common to create and play.
    - ``widgets`` for widgets common to create and play.

  - The ``site`` folder for the page of the site and its widgets.
  - The ``style`` folder for global SCSS files.
  - The ``widgets`` folder for global widgets.

- The ``assets`` folder contains all the images, fonts, media files (if small!) of the application.
- The ``aurelia_project`` folder contains:

  - ``aurelia.json`` the configuration file of `aurelia-cli <https://github.com/aurelia/cli>`__.
  - The tasks and libraries used by aurelia-cli to work.

- The ``config`` folder contains:

  - A `TOML <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`__ file per build type (dev, prod, staging and testing). These files are used to build ``application.js`` the config file of the application.
  - A JS file containing the configuration of the application. This files mostly describe how to connect to the API. It is built from the TOML configuration files.

- The ``dist`` folder (untracked) will contain the built bundles that are used in the browser.
- The ``locale`` folder contains a subdirectory per lang. Each subdirectory contains a JS file exporting an object containing the translations for this language. These JS files are updated with ``npm run translate``.
- The ``scripts`` folder contains:

  - Utility scripts for various tasks (update translations, lint templates, â€¦).
  - JS scripts that don't belong to the app but are required for it to work (require.js, text.js, tracking.js, polyfills.js)

- Unit tests go into the ``test/unit`` folder. The structure of the ``test/unit`` folder should reflect the structure of the app.

Code conventions
----------------

- Tests files should have the same name than the file they are testing and end with the ``.spec.js`` extension.
- Private methods and attributes starts with an underscore ``_``. In a service this means that the method or the attribute shouldn't be accessed outside of it. In the JS part of a Custom Element, it means the method or attribute shouldn't be used in the HTML template.

Commit
------

We try to follow the same `rules as the angular project <https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit>`__ towards commits. Each commit is constituted from a summary line, a body and eventually a footer. Each part are separated with a blank line.

The summary line is as follow: ``<type>(<scope>): <short description>``. It must not end with a dot and must be written in present imperative. Don't capitalize the fist letter. The whole line shouldn't be longer than 80 characters and if possible be between 70 and 75 characters. This is intended to have better logs.

The possible types are :

- chore for changes in the build process or auxiliary tools.
- doc for documentation
- feat for new features
- ref: for refactoring
- style for modifications that not change the meaning of the code.
- test: for tests

The body should be written in imperative. It can contain multiple paragraph. Feel free to use bullet points.

Use the footer to reference issue, pull requests or other commits.

This is a full example:

::

   feat(css): use CSS sprites to speed page loading

   - Generate sprites with the gulp-sprite-generator plugin.
   - Add a build-sprites task in gulpfile

   Close #24

git hooks
---------

git hooks allow you to launch a script before or after a git command. They are very handy to automatically perform checks. If the script exits with a non 0 status, the git command will be aborted. You must write them in the `.git/hooks/` folder in a file following the convention: ``<pre|post>-<git-action>``. You must not forget to make them executable, eg: ``chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit``.

In the case you don't want to launch the hooks, append the ``--no-verify`` option to the git command you want to use.

pre-commit
++++++++++

.. code:: bash

   #!/usr/bin/env bash

   set -e

   npm run lint

pre-push
++++++++

This is only useful if you don't use ``npm run tdd`` during development.

.. code:: bash

   #!/usr/bin/env bash

   set -e

   npm run test

Translations
============

The translations are generated from `this google doc <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YWBqm7OUVshYZhVrKiCnbuYBUcPlLtB0dR7rqpWbevU/edit#gid=1072267331>`__. Each sheet correspond to a part of the application: site (for all the pages of the site), game (for gobal game traductions), game/create, game/play, global (for global translations), cards (for the translations of names and descriptions of the cards), trumps (for the translations of the names and descriptions of the trumps). To update the JSON in the frontend, use either:

- `npm run translate`
- `python3 scripts/translate.py`

The translations are performed in the browser by the `aurelia-i18n <https://github.com/aurelia/i18n>`__ plugin.

To translate something:

#. Add the relevant key in the spreadsheet.
#. Update the JSON files containing the translations.
#. In the HTML, use if possible (ie text/html that don't rely on aurelia binding):

   - the ``t`` tag with the key as value. For instance: ``<span t="site.connection_button"></span>``. If the translated text contains HMTL, add ``[html]`` before the key: ``<span t="[html]site.homepage.pitch"></span>``. If you need some value provided by aurelia in the code, delimit it with __ and use the ``t-params.bind`` to supply the value. Eg, use the value ``C'est le tour de <br><strong>__playerName__</strong>`` and this code to supply ``playerName``:

     .. code:: html

        <p class="centered-important"
           t="[html]game.play.whose_turn_message"
           t-params.bind="{playerName: currentPlayerName}">
        </p>

   - the TValueConverter (if you cannot use the option above): ``${ 'TAKEN' | t}``.

#. If you need to translate trough the code:

   #. Inject the I18N service.
   #. Translate with ``this._i18n.tr('cards.queen_red')`` or ``this._i18n.tr('cards.queen_red', {toto: 'toto'})`` if the value requires some string to be replaced.

See `the plugin page on github <https://github.com/aurelia/i18n>`__ for the full documentation.


Add a hero
==========

#. Add the main image in ``asserts/game/heroes/<hero-name>.png`` (used in hero selection)
#. Add the circled image in ``asserts/game/heroes/<hero-name>-circle.png`` (used in the game)
#. Add the name of the hero in the static array named ``heroes`` in ``app/game/game.js``


Update the dependencies
=======================

#. Change the versions in ``package.json``.
#. Run ``npm install`` to update them.
#. Build the application for dev, prod and run the tests to check everything is running as expected.

Update aurelia-cli
------------------

#. Update the version in ``package.json``.
#. Diff the ``aurelia_project`` folder with one from a new and similar project. To create a project:

   #. Run ``au new tmp``.
   #. Follow the instructions. Use ES6 and SASS to have similar tasks.

#. Update files in ``aurelia_project/tasks`` based on the diff.
#. Check that the build and test tasks are running correctly.
